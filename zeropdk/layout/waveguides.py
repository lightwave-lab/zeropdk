    This was updated over many iterations of failure. It can be used for both

    Args:
        points_list: list of pya.DPoint (at least 2 points)
        width (microns): constant or list. If list, then it has to have the same length as points
        dbu: dbu: typically 0.001, only used for accuracy calculations.
        smooth: tries to smooth final polygons to avoid very sharp edges (greater than 130 deg)
